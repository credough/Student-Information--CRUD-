# Student Information System (C Language)

This is a simple Student Information System written in C. It allows users to add, view, update, and delete student records. All data is saved in a `.txt` file so that the program can load and store student information even after closing.

This project was built using basic C concepts like functions, file handling, arrays, and loops. It does not use pointers to keep things beginner-friendly.

## Features

- Add student with ID and name
- View the list of students
- Update an existing student's name using their ID
- Delete a student by ID
- Data is stored in `students.txt` using file handling

## How to Run

1. Open the project in Code::Blocks or any C compiler.
2. Make sure the file `students.txt` is in the same folder as your `.c` file (it will be created automatically if it doesn't exist).
3. Compile and run the program.
4. Use the menu to interact with the system.

## Notes

- This project was created for learning and practice purposes.
